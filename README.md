# NeReact

A lightweight (a milles faster) replacement of React framewo... I mean library.

## Usage

Check out `Example.js`, if that is too boring, then here's summary:

```js

// Register route
const page = new Route('#', HeReact.createElements('<h1>Hello from HeReact</h1>'));

HeReact.addRoute(page);
```

## Installation

Must be included as first script in html (HeReact.js)

```
<script src="./HeReact.js"></script>
```

That's it
